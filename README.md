# [Mobile-App Development Portfolio](#)
<!-- (https://www.mobile-app-portfolio.AUTO.com) -->


Explore my GitHub Mono-Repo Hub of innovation with diverse mobile app projects in Flutter, Pure Native (Android, iOS, Windows Phone / Universal Windows Platform - UWP / .NET MAUI), and Web Mobile (React Native, Ionic, NativeScript, etc) specifically. 

UI styles like Material, Argon, and more, blended seamlessly with Flutter & Pure Native/Web Mobile frameworks. 

It will be a playground for dynamic tech stack combinations, in Mobile app frameworks only (Ongoing project, as my public code will be released in timely intervals).
