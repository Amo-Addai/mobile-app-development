- flutter, sdk, paths,
- android-studio - dart & flutter dependencies
- setup flutter project

- kaggle.com - download 'Pose .. ' data-set (train & valid sets)
NB: 'pose .. /[train/valid]/' has 10 poses; best to work with all types for model-training
eg. apples, avocados, bananas, grapes, guava, limes, mangos, oranges, pineapples, watermelons, ..

- teachablemachine.withgoogle.com
    - Image Project (also has Audio, Pose, Gait, etc)
    - set/create classes (all 10) for each type chosen from 'pose .. /train/' data-set & upload their respective training data sets
    - Train Model
        - set default hyper-params
            - epochs (50), batch-size (16), learning-rate (0.001)
        - Train Model (wait whenever web page slows down)

    - After Model trained, in Preview section
        - Test with File (or Webcam - with a real pose)
        - upload test data - image(s) from each chosen pose data-set
        - Results - <100% Classified Pose
    - Export Model
        - Tensorflow Lite (or Tensorflow / Tensorflow.js)
        - Model conversion type: Floating point
        - Download your model
    - Export downloaded 'converted_tflite.zip'
    - Copy 'model_unquant.tflite' & 'labels.txt' into 'assets/ai/' directory in 'pose_recogniser' flutter project
        - in labels.txt, remove '0 ', '1 ', .. numbering from all pose labels
