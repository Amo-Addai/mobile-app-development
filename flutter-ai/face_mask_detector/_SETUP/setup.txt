- flutter, sdk, paths,
- android-studio - dart & flutter dependencies
- setup flutter project

- kaggle.com - download 'Faces & Masks' data-set (training & test sets) - or find a good source for such data

- teachablemachine.withgoogle.com
    - Image Project (also has Audio, Pose, Gait, etc)
    - upload both 'faces' & 'masks' training data sets for 'Face' & 'Mask' classes respectively
    - Train Model
        - set default hyper-params
            - epochs (50), batch-size (16), learning-rate (0.001)
        - Train Model (wait whenever web page slows down)
        
    - After Model trained, in Preview section
        - Test with File (or Webcam - with a real face/mask)
        - upload test data - image(s) from 'faces' & 'masks'
        - Results - <100% Face / Mask
    - Export Model
        - Tensorflow Lite (or Tensorflow / Tensorflow.js)
        - Model conversion type: Floating point
        - Download your model
    - Export downloaded 'converted_tflite.zip'
    - Copy 'model_unquant.tflite' & 'labels.txt' into 'assets/ai/' directory in 'face_mask_detector' flutter project
        - in labels.txt, remove '0 ' & '1 ' numbering from both 'Face' & 'Mask' labels
