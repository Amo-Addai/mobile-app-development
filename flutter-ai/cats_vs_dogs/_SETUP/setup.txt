- flutter, sdk, paths,
- android-studio - dart & flutter dependencies
- setup flutter project

- kaggle.com - download 'Cat and Dog' data-set (training & test sets)

- teachablemachine.withgoogle.com
    - Image Project (also has Audio, Pose, Gait, etc)
    - set/create 2 classes 'Cat' & 'Dog' & upload both 'cats' & 'dogs' training data sets for them
    - Train Model
        - set default hyper-params
            - epochs (50), batch-size (16), learning-rate (0.001)
        - Train Model (wait whenever web page slows down)
        
    - After Model trained, in Preview section
        - Test with File (or Webcam - with a real cat/dog)
        - upload test data - image(s) from 'cats' & 'dogs'
        - Results - <100% Cat / Dog
    - Export Model
        - Tensorflow Lite (or Tensorflow / Tensorflow.js)
        - Model conversion type: Floating point
        - Download your model
    - Export downloaded 'converted_tflite.zip'
    - Copy 'model_unquant.tflite' & 'labels.txt' into 'assets/ai/' directory in 'cats_vs_dogs' flutter project
        - in labels.txt, remove '0 ' & '1 ' numbering from both 'Cat' & 'Dog' labels
