- flutter, sdk, paths,
- android-studio - dart & flutter dependencies
- setup flutter project

- kaggle.com - download 'Marvel Heroes' data-set (train & valid sets)
NB: 'marvel/[train/valid]/' has 8 avenger-types; best to work with all types for model-training
eg. Black Widow, Captain America, Doctor Strange, Hulk, Iron Man, Loki, Spider Man, Thanos, ..

- teachablemachine.withgoogle.com
    - Image Project (also has Audio, Pose, Gait, etc)
    - set/create classes (all 8) for each type chosen from 'marvel/train/' data-set & upload their respective training data sets
    - Train Model
        - set default hyper-params
            - epochs (50), batch-size (16), learning-rate (0.001)
        - Train Model (wait whenever web page slows down)

    - After Model trained, in Preview section
        - Test with File (or Webcam - with a real avenger-type)
        - upload test data - image(s) from each chosen avenger-type data-set
        - Results - <100% Classified Avenger-Type
    - Export Model
        - Tensorflow Lite (or Tensorflow / Tensorflow.js)
        - Model conversion type: Floating point
        - Download your model
    - Export downloaded 'converted_tflite.zip'
    - Copy 'model_unquant.tflite' & 'labels.txt' into 'assets/ai/' directory in 'avengers_characters_recognizer' flutter project
        - in labels.txt, remove '0 ', '1 ', .. numbering from all avenger-type labels
