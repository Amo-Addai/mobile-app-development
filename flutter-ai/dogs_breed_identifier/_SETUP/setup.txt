- flutter, sdk, paths,
- android-studio - dart & flutter dependencies
- setup flutter project

- kaggle.com - download 'Dog Breeds' data-set (data & images sets)
NB: 'images/' has too many dog breeds; best to work with <10 breeds for faster model-training
eg. Husky, Corgi, Retriever, Shiba, Chihuahua, Pomeranian, Pomski, ..

- teachablemachine.withgoogle.com
    - Image Project (also has Audio, Pose, Gait, etc)
    - set/create classes (<10) for each breed chosen from 'images/' data-set & upload their respective training data sets
    - Train Model
        - set default hyper-params
            - epochs (50), batch-size (16), learning-rate (0.001)
        - Train Model (wait whenever web page slows down)
        
    - After Model trained, in Preview section
        - Test with File (or Webcam - with a real dog-breed)
        - upload test data - image(s) from each chosen dog-breed data-set
        - Results - <100% Classified Dog-Breed
    - Export Model
        - Tensorflow Lite (or Tensorflow / Tensorflow.js)
        - Model conversion type: Floating point
        - Download your model
    - Export downloaded 'converted_tflite.zip'
    - Copy 'model_unquant.tflite' & 'labels.txt' into 'assets/ai/' directory in 'dogs_breed_identifier' flutter project
        - in labels.txt, remove '0 ', '1 ', .. numbering from all dog-breed labels
